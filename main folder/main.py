#this project is a little python script for mr modeegger
#here is the goal that:
# get a random number from 1 to 13, store this number somewhere, for each iteration, this number cant be chosen, maybe
# signal if the iterattion is done, there should be an option to see all previous entrys, all entrys should be deleted if the iteration is done.

import random
